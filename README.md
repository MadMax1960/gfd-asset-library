# GFD Blender Presets

A collection of Material presets for the GFS/GMD Blender Importer. These materials are useful only in the case of importing into the game. 

Please read through the entire readme, as just downloading this with even *basic* Blender knowledge and applying them won't work. 




## Features

- General Presets for Skin, Clothes, and Hair
- Gold and Metal Presets
- (Summoned) Persona Preset
- P3D, 4D, and 5D Default Preset


## How to add to your Asset Library

A quick rundown of how to use these. 

**MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE GFS/GMS BLENDER PLUGIN**

Download the gfd and blend file by clicking the Green "code" button then download as zip. Unzip the file and open the .blend in blender. 

Once you open the blend, you should see the armature with the uv balls inside it.

You then want to nagivate to the meshes, and then the material tab

Then right click on the material and click "mark as asset"

Do this to each material you want, there is one material per uv sphere. 

Once you've marked the assets you want, open the asset library in blender.

Now make a new category, you can get as creative as you want with this. For instance you could make multiple for different scenarios if you plan on expanding your own preset library. So a "metal," "character," "clothes," "reflective," etc. To keep it simple though, I'll just be making a "gfd" category to add the materials too.

Now go back to "unassigned," then click and drag to select all your materials, dragging them into your new category.

Now you want to click "save as" and save this new blend.

You want to save this blend in your asset library folder, if you don't know where it is, or don't have one. Go to **Edits --> Preferences --> File Paths**
